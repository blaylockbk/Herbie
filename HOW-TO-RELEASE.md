# How to publish a new release of the `herbie-data` package on PyPI and conda-forge

## Pre-step

Update Herbie version number in

- Update `./CITATION.cff` citation document
- Update `./docs/_static/switcher.json` with a new item for the version you will soon create
  - (You will need to go into the _readthedocs.org_ dashboard and activate the version later.)
- Make sure all leftover changes on main are committed that you want.
- **Create a tag and release in GitHub**.

> Note: The tag name should follow the pattern `YYYY.MM.0`
>
> - `YYYY` is the four-digit year the tag is created.
> - `MM` is the month number the tag is created with _no leading zeros_ (PyPI doesn't care about leading zeros).
> - `0` - The micro update, set to `0` for the first release of the month, otherwise increment by 1 if there is more than one release in the same month (i.e., a bug fix).
>   > Note: I do _NOT_ prepend the version name with `v` (I have chosen to not include that.)

## üì¶ Publish to PyPI

This is done automatically by the GitHub Action `.github/workflows/release_to_pypi.yml`

Just create a release with a tag named `20YY.MM.#`

The build process will start automatically.

1. The action uses the [build](https://github.com/pypa/build) tool to build my package following the steps from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-package-your-python-code-df5a7739ab2e).
1. The action then uses [pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish](https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish#specifying-a-different-username) to upload the package to PyPI

After the action completes, confirm the file was uploaded to PyPI at <https://pypi.org/project/herbie-data/>.

## üêç Publish to Conda

Updating the Conda package involves updating the herbie-data feedstock, specifically updating the version in the `meta.yml` file. You should get a notification from the herbie-data feedstock repo saying that it detected a new version and open a pull request. If it looks good, merge the pull request.

Manually updating the package on conda-forge involves the following steps:

1. Fork the [herbie-data Conda feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/herbie-data-feedstock/pull/1/checks?check_run_id=11936300099)
1. Follow the instructions in the README to update the build
   - Update version
   - Update sha256 has for the `herbie-data-{version}.tar.gz` file (found on PyPI) in the "Download files" tab.
   - Set build to 0 for releasing a new version.
1. Create pull request.
1. Follow instructions in the pull request template.

## üìÑ readthedocs

1. If a new version is included in the version switcher, then you'll need to activate the pages for that version.
