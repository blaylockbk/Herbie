    "As noted in **Part 1**, HRRR GRIB2 files can be downloaded from the [University of Utah's HRRR archive](http://hrrr.chpc.utah.edu/) on the CHPC Pando archive system. You may also get HRRR GRIB2 files from the [NOAA Operational Model Archive and Distribution System (NOMADS)](https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/), but only for the today's and yesterday's runs. In **Part 1** I showed you a function that can may be used to download many full GRIB2 files.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to download **just select \"fields\" of a GRIB2 file** instead of the full file. We have to use the `cURL` command line program to download a range of bytes from a file. Fortunatly, `cURL` should be included in your Anaconda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background Info\n",
    "\n",
    "You first need to know how GRIB files work. The GRIB file format is made up of gridded binary \"fields\" stacked on top of one another. A GRIB \"field\" contains the information for a single variable at a certain level. We can target one or more of these fields in the file and just download the layers we want by downloading a *range of bytes* from the file. An \"index\" or `.idx` file has a list of GRIB messages that tell us what data is on each level and *what the beginning byte is for each field*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![image1](./images/GRIB2_file_cURL.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You should know that it is not possible to subset the file download based on geographic region. The reason is because the byte location for specific grid points are not known, just the first and last byte of the variable \"field\".\n",
