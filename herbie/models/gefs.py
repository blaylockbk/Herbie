    """Template for GEFS Reforecast data.

    These grib files are organized different from other model types.
    The files are grouped into variables and clumped by forecast range.
    Thus, instead of a one file having all the variables for that lead time,
    a file has one variable for many lead times. This changes the way
    a user would use Herbie to access GEFS data. A user will need to supply
    the "variable". For getting specific grib messages, you will use the
    "searchString" argument to key in on the variable of interest. However,
    you will still need to give a value for "fxx" to tell Herbie which
    directory to look for. Yeah, it's a little different paradigm for Herbie,
    but we can work with it.

    Provide arguments for

    - date (2000-2019)
    - member {1,2,3,4}
    - fxx (0-384)
    - variable_level (e.g., tmp_2m, acpc_sfc, ugrd_10m, etc.)
