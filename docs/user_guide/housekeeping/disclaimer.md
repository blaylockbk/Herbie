# 👨🏻‍🏭 Disclaimer & Contributing Guide

Herbie continues to evolve and is distributed _as is_. I do not make any guarantee it will work for you out of the box or is tailored to your needs. Honestly, this package is my playground for developing my python skills and testing new ideas in my free time. 

With that said, I am happy to share this project with you. If this is helpful to you in any way, I'm glad. You are welcome to open issues when you see a problem, ask questions in the discussion, submit pull requests if you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, and improve the documentation. I really appreciate the communities help and have learned a lot from you.
