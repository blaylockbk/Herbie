# 📜 History

**👨🏻‍🎓 During my PhD at the University of Utah**, I created, at the time, the only publicly accessible archive of HRRR data. Over 1,000 research scientists and professionals used that archive. In the latter half of 2020, the HRRR data was made available through the [NOAA Open Data Dissemination Program](https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/open-data-dissemination) (formerly the NOAA Big Data Program). The Herbie package organizes and expands my original download scripts into a more coherent package with the extended ability to download more than just the HRRR and RAP model data and from different data sources. It will continue to evolve at my own leisure.

**🌹 What's in a name?** I originally released this package under the name "HRRR-B" because it only dealt with the HRRR dataset, and the "B" is for my initial. Since then, I have added the ability to access data from many more models. Thus, it was re-branded with the name "Herbie," named after a favorite childhood movie.
