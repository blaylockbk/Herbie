"""
Just playing around with downloading radar data, in case I ever need to
do it. I should put non-model related downloads in a separate folder.
This dosn't work very well because the datetime is not predicatble.
I would need to implement a "nearest_time" search like I do in
`GOES-2-go` to make this feasible.

If you know the exact datetime of a file, Hebie can find and download it
H = Herbie('2021-10-13 00:07:21', product='level2', model='nexrad', station='KMAF')
H.download()

But this isn't the best implementation. Instead of reinventing the wheel,
you might want to use `nexradaws`
